# A quick note on how to test whether the dependencies work, and you've
# installed everything.

Type

```
$ ipython                   # Launches ipython instance
>>> import scipy
>>> import sklearn
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> quit()
$                           # Back to instance of bash
$ ipython notebook          # Launches a Jupyter server, this might not work
```
