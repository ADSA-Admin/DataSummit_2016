# Testing guide

A quick note on how to test whether the dependencies work,
and you've installed everything. Please let us know if we have to
modify any of the below commands.

Type

```
$ ipython                   # Launches ipython instance
>>> import scipy
>>> import sklearn
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> quit()
$                           # Back to instance of bash
$ ipython notebook          # Launches a Jupyter server, this might not work
```
